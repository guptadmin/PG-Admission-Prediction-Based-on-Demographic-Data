The project titled “Prediction of Admission & Jobs in Engineering & Technology with Respect to Demographic Locations” is a prototype web application aimed at helping students estimate their chances of getting admitted into technical programs and potentially securing a job, based on academic scores and demographic background. The idea is rooted in offering guidance and clarity to students from different regions and socioeconomic groups, especially those unsure of their future educational and career paths.

This system uses a simulated scoring model inspired by basic machine learning logic (like decision trees or logistic regression), where each input—such as academic percentage, location type (urban/rural), income group, and social category—contributes to a final score. The total score is then mapped to predefined prediction categories: High, Medium, or Low chances of admission and job opportunities.

The application’s frontend is built using React.js, providing a clean and interactive interface with responsive design, while the backend (optional) is powered by Python or Node.js depending on deployment needs. The prediction logic is either written directly in JavaScript or served via a backend API.
